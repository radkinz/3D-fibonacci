# The Fibonacci Sequence Visualized in 3D
A 3D structure that visualizes the Fibonacci sequence by displaying a block spiral (similar to the Fibonacci spiral), where the sizes of the blocks are based on the Fibonacci ratio. The 3D blocks are rendered using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), which is a JavaScript library that creates 3D computer graphics using WEBGL.

## The Fibonacci Sequence
[The fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) is an infinite sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. For example, the first 4 numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2.
As one can notice, 2 is the sum of 1+1 and the second 1 is the sum of 1+0.

## The Fibonacci Spiral

The approximate rate of change for every nth number in the Fibonacci sequence is very close to the golden ratio. Thus, if we use the Fibonacci numbers to act as lengths of squares and display those squares, we can see a beautiful spiral as seen in the image above.
