# The Fibonacci Sequence Visualized in 3D

## The Fibonacci Sequence

The fibonacci sequence is an infinite sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it. For example, the first 4 numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2.
As one can notice, 2 is the sum of 1+1 and the second 1 is the sum of 1+0.

## The Fibonacci Spiral

The approximate rate of change for every nth number in the fibnacci sequence is very close to the golden ratio. Thus, if we use the fibonacci numbers to act as lengths of squares and display those squares, we can see a beautiful spiral.
